# Editor Extender Extreme

## <cg>The best Editor Extender mod on the market!</c>

This mod lets you have an infinite editor or even allows you to limit the editor if that is what you are into. 

It allows both horizontal and vertical extension, and changing the starting x and y positions too!

You can customize all this in the mod's **<cy>settings</c>**.

<cb>macOS support planned, just requires rewriting a bunch more methods</c>

<cr>Note that this mod will break Free Scroll and Place Over hacks, which is why I have included them in settings as well.</c>
